## Management command

You can populate the database with test data to test the service.

* `python manage.py load_album` - Load albums from `albums.json` to db with
  API. You need start your server before.

## Configurations

* Python version: 3.10
* Libraries: [requirements.txt]()

## Launch

### Local server

- Download code
- Through the console in the directory with the code, install the virtual
  environment with the command:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

- Activate the virtual environment with the command:

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

- Install the libraries with the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Write the environment variables in the `.env` file in the format KEY=VALUE

`SECRET_KEY` - A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used
to provide cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable
value.

`ALLOWED_HOSTS` - A list of strings representing the host/domain names that
this Django site can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host
header attacks, which are possible even under many seemingly-safe web server
configurations.

`DEBUG` - A boolean that turns on/off debug mode. If your app raises an
exception when DEBUG is True, Django will display a detailed traceback,
including a lot of metadata about your environment, such as all the currently
defined Django settings (from settings.py).

`DATABASE_URL` - URL to db. For more information
check [this](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url).

P.S. Default values are already set

- Create your database with the command:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

- Run local server with the command (it will be available
  at http://127.0.0.1:8000/):

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
